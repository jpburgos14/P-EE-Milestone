            <h1>About Light Pollution</h1>
            <p>Light pollution is a growing problem in urban areas. It not only obscures our view of stars but also has
                significant impacts on wildlife and human health. The introduction of artificial lights has transformed our
                nights, disrupting natural cycles.</p>

            <h3>Types of Light Pollution</h3>
            <p>Light pollution isn't just one thing - it comes in a few different forms, each with its own problems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Skyglow:</b> That hazy glow over cities that blocks out the stars. It's caused by light scattering
                    in the atmosphere.</li>
                <li><b>Glare:</b> Super bright lights that hurt your eyes and make it hard to see. Think of unshielded
                    streetlights or those blinding headlights.</li>
                <li><b>Light trespass:</b> When light spills over where it's not wanted, like into your neighbor's yard
                    or bedroom window.</li>
                <li><b>Clutter:</b> A jumble of bright lights that's confusing and distracting. Common in cities with tons
                    of signs and lights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sources of Light Pollution</h3>
            <p>Where does all this extra light come from?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cities and towns:</b> Streetlights, buildings, and those bright billboards all add to the
                    problem.</li>
                <li><b>Industrial areas:</b> Factories and warehouses often have powerful lights that shine into the
                    night sky.</li>
                <li><b>Homes:</b> Even our porch lights, garden lights, and security systems can contribute if they're
                    not designed carefully.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact on Environment</h3>
            <p>Light pollution messes with nature's rhythm. Animals that rely on darkness get confused, and it can
                disrupt their feeding, mating, and migration.</p>


            <h3>Impact on Human Health</h3>
            <p>Too much light at night messes with our sleep. It disrupts our natural sleep-wake cycle and can even lead
                to health problems like insomnia, fatigue, and even more serious stuff.</p> <br>
